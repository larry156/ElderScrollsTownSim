# TESPolymorphism
Like the polymorphism repo, except not for school, and this time I'm using Elder Scrolls races and improving (hopefully) some features. This is very much still a work in progress.

# COMBAT EXPLANATION
Each Citizen in the town has a combatSkill, which is a randomly generated integer determined when they move in, and is affected by their race. combatSkill can range from -10 to +30.
If a Citizen enters combat with someone, each participant rolls a number from 0 to 100 + their combatSkill.
Whoever has the higher roll wins that fight.
