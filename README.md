# TESPolymorphism
Inspired by a school assignment, though with improved features, a different theme, and some other changes.
This is very much still a work in progress.

# COMBAT EXPLANATION
Each Citizen in the town has a combatSkill, which is a randomly generated integer determined when they move in, and is affected by their race. combatSkill can range from -10 to +30.
If a Citizen enters combat with someone, each participant rolls a number from 0 to 100 + their combatSkill.
Whoever has the higher roll wins that fight.
