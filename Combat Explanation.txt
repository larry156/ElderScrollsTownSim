Each Citizen in the town has a combatSkill, which is a randomly generated integer determined when they move in, and is affected by their race. combatSkill can range from -10 to +30.
If a Citizen enters combat with someone, each participant rolls a a number, combatRoll, which has their combatSkill added to it.
Whoever has the higher modified combatRoll wins that fight.
